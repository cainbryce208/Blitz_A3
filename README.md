# Blitz_A3
Blitz is a free for all gamemode for Arma 3 with a twist. Once you kill a player, you'll gain some buffs like a increase in movement speed and reduced damage. You will have to kill more players soon after your first kill to retain these buffs or you die and respawn. The idea is to keep up that killing spree. These players with buffs are called "blitzed" players. Those who are not blizted will always be given the ability to place a mine to prevent the blitzed players from continiously running their streak. Any feature like mine count, time to need to kill, movement speed given, etc. Can be changed and modified as much as you want. Dedicated server setup and a self hosted server setup vary with these options. Wiki will eventually have all the info you need for this.
